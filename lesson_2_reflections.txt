How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary container that lies between the working directory
 and the repository.  The working directory is broad and holds everything 
that you are working on and the repository holds only the important 
items that you need to keep track of.  The staging area allows you 
to add things that you're about ready to commit to the respository.
