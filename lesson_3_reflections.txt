When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository to collaborate with other developers or when
working on different machines in different locations (work and home).  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You wouldn't want to be interrupted with new additions when you are working on something
everytime Git decides to pull from the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When wouldyou use one
instead of another?

Forks are when you want to clone someone else's repository on Github to your own GitHub.  This 
way you have your own set of files that you can share, manage, and modify.  Cloning is similar
to forking in that you are making exact copies of a repository, except you are getting files from
a remote onto your computer or making a copy from the files on your own computer. Branches are
when you make changes to a repository and want to go experiment with out modifying or braking the 
master branch.
