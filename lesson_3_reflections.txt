When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository to collaborate with other developers or when
working on different machines in different locations (work and home).  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You wouldn't want to be interrupted with new additions when you are working on something
everytime Git decides to pull from the remote repository.
